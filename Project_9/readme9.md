### PROJECT 9 - TOOLING WEBSITE DEPLOYMENT AUTOMATION WITH CONTINUOUS INTEGRATION. INTRODUCTION TO JENKINS

This project is an introduction into automation. In the previous projects we have been able to make some web solution deployments on a smaller scale but imagine in real life scenario you need to make some builds on a larger scale, at that time the set up will become more cumbersome and time consuming. Automation of these setup processes eases the stress and saves time. 

DevOps is about Agility, and speedy release of software and web solutions. One of the ways to guarantee fast and repeatable deployments is Automation of routine tasks.

In this project we are going to start automating part of our routine tasks with a free and open source automation server – [Jenkins](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jenkins_(software)). It is one of the most popular [CI/CD](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CI/CD) tools, it was created by a former Sun Microsystems developer Kohsuke Kawaguchi and the project originally had a named “Hudson”.

According to Circle CI, Continuous integration (CI) is a software development strategy that increases the speed of development while ensuring the quality of the code that teams deploy. Developers continually commit code in small increments (at least daily, or even several times a day), which is then automatically built and tested before it is merged with the shared repository.

In our project we are going to utilize Jenkins CI capabilities to make sure that every change made to the source code in GitHub https://github.com/<yourname>/tooling will be automatically be updated to the Tooling Website.

Important concepts to read about -- [Continuous Integration](https://circleci.com/continuous-integration/), [Continuous Delivery](https://circleci.com/continuous-integration/) and [Continuous Deployment](https://circleci.com/continuous-integration/).
