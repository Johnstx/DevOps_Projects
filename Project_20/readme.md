## MIGRATING APPLICATIONS/SOLUTIONS TO THE CLOUD USING DOCKER

### Containerization using **DOCKER**

This lab will migrate a custom application, **[Enterprise website deployment](https://github.com/Johnstx/DevOps_Projects/tree/main/Project_19)** which was previously deployed via a VM based environment to the cloud employing use of docker  container.

### Solutions used -
* Docker Engine
* Docker deamon
* Docker registry
* Jenkins 

### **Prerequisites:-**

1. Install [Docker Engine](https://docs.docker.com/engine/), a client-server application that contains: 
 * A server with a long-running daemon process dockerd.
 * APIs that specify interfaces that programs can use to talk to and instruct the Docker daemon.
 * A command-line interface (CLI) client docker.
